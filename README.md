# Relational Database of Student Records
I created a SQL script to manage a relational database of student records. 

# About the database
No real student records were used. The database was created to reflect what I would see when I taught courses.

student_record.csv: Information about student names, IDs, and enrollment status.
writing_section_1.csv: Points assigned for a writing assignment (out of 50); graded by TA 1.
writing_section_2.csv: Points assigned for a writing assignment (out of 50); graded by TA 2.
midterm_score.csv: Midterm scores for all students who took the exam, including dropped students.
final_score.csv: Final exam scores for all students who took the exam, including dropped students.
